# Showme-native

Showme is app for finding great concerts from around the web. You can find a web version of this project at [showme](https://www.showme.band).

## Set up

If you would like to run this application, you will need to install "Expo Go" from the App/Play store. Next go to this [link](https://expo.io/@samwise__/projects/showme) and scan the QR code using the "Expo Go" app.

Otherwise feel free to clone the app. You will need to set up an [Expo environment](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) as well.

## TODO

The main issue right now is setting up casting, which has ended up being a headache. Hopefully it will be available soon...
